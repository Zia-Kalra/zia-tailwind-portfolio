# Personal Portfolio - Tailwind CSS Bootcamp

This is my personal portfolio website created using HTML and Tailwind CSS. It includes sections for Home, About Me, Projects, and Contact. I learned a lot about Tailwind utilities, flex/grid layouts, and responsiveness during this build.

## Features
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- Resume download button
- Project cards with hover effects
- Contact form (frontend only)
